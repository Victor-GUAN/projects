This project aims to design and development of the core Java infrastructure for the myVelib
system.

In the files, "myVelib" is the project file, "test" is for the JUnit Tests.

* You can run the project by two ways:
	- in Eclipse, directly run the "RunMe.java" or the "Demo.java".
	- in CMD, choose and set your environment path and file path properly,
	  then use "javac"(with .java suffix) and "java"(without .java suffix and add the package name and path before) commands 
	  to run the "RunMe.java" or the "Demo.java".

* If you want to see a simple demo of the operation of the system,
  then you can run the "Demo.java" file, which is an automatic operation of the system
  by Multi-Thread running method.

* If you want to directly use the CLUI, then you can run the "RunMe.java",
  which can realize the CLUI corresponding to the demands of part 2 of the project.
