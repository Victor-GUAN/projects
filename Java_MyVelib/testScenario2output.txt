A plan has been constructed, which has name "mynetwork" and consists of 5 stations each of which has 10 electronic and 10 mechanical parking slots and such that stations are arranged on a square grid whose of side 3.0km and initially populated with a 0% bikes randomly distributed over the 5 stations.
A user nameduserhas been added to the plan mynetwork. They holds a velib card of type vlibre, and their location is x:0.5, y: 0.5
The station of ID: 1 in the plan myplan has been set offline at time unit: 0.5
The station of ID: 1 in the plan myplan has been set online at time unit: 3.0
