A plan has been constructed, which has name "myplan" and consists of 4 stations each of which has 10 electronic and 10 mechanical parking slots and such that stations are arranged on a square grid whose of side 2.0km and initially populated with a 0% bikes randomly distributed over the 4 stations.
A user nameduser1has been added to the plan myplan. They holds a velib card of type vlibre, and their location is x:0.5, y: 0.5
A user nameduser2has been added to the plan myplan. They holds a velib card of type vmax, and their location is x:2.0, y: 1.0
