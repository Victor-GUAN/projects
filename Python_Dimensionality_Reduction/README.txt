This project aims to realize the dimensionality reduction technics with some machine learning methods (PCA, t-SNE, clustering methods, etc.).

The main part is to create a new upgraded version of t-SNE method. With this new method, the efficiency and accuracy of the dimensionality reduction is highly improved.

Furthermore, by this new method, we can well display and manipulate the different steps of simulation for a massive dataset during the reduction of dimension.
